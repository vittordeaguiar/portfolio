# Personal Portfolio (Work in Progress)

![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow)

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This repository contains the initial setup for my portfolio website. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences, but currently, it serves as a landing page redirecting to my main links.

## Current Status

The project is still in progress. At this stage, the website primarily functions as a redirect hub to my main links, such as my LinkedIn, GitHub, and other professional profiles.

## Planned Features

- **Detailed Project Showcase**: Sections for each project, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations and transitions for a dynamic user experience.
